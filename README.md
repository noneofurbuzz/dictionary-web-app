## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/) 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

The Free Dictionary API was very confusing and the API response was very scattered as there were multiple duplicate objects.

- I learnt how to use the filter method in javascript to filter the data from the API response.

- I learnt how to integrate audio
